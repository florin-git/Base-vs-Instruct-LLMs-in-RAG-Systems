The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights, a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign. Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, has stated that the cylinder was \"the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths-a new kind of statecraft.\" It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire. On October 14, the Mohammad Reza Shah's sister, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder.

It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare .

Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : '' The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as '' ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... .

The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date .

Following cell signalling , two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic region As these form , a lumen develops within them , at which point , they are referred to as endocardial tubes . At the same time that the tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed . The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube , the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions .

In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health .

Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal .

This is the most widely seen goal . Criminals have taken improper advantage , or inflicted unfair detriment , upon others and consequently , the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to '' balance the scales . '' People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws , they surrender the rights granted to them by the law . Thus , one who murders may be executed himself . A related theory includes the idea of '' righting the balance . '' Deterrence -- Individual deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender . The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior . General deterrence aims at society at large . By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses , other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses . Incapacitation -- Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct . This is often achieved through prison sentences today . The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose . Rehabilitation -- Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society . Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong . Restoration -- This is a victim - oriented theory of punishment . The goal is to repair , through state authority , any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender . For example , one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired . Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in the civil law , i.e. , returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury .","idx_gold_in_corpus":21033675},{"example_id":-7812477442387862913,"question":"who appoints the members of the board of governors of the federal reserve","answers":["the President"],"text":"The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , commonly known as the Federal Reserve Board , is the main governing body of the Federal Reserve System .

This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel 's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development , including generation of the first nucleated cell from a '' monerula '' , a structureless mass of primordial mucus ( '' Urschleim '' ) . Therefore , the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time . However , Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups , including amphibians and molluscs . Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884 . This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity . In 1873 , August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity . The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later , after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed .","idx_gold_in_corpus":21034353},{"example_id":-2137604602549564981,"question":"when did the first immigrants come to hawaii","answers":["Around 1200"],"text":"The history of Hawaii describes the era of human settlements in the Hawaiian Islands.

Unlike Lamarck , Darwin proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Darwin based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Darwin 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during '' the eclipse of Darwinism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S.

This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann .

The sugar component consists of alternating residues of \u03b2-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) . Attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids. The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer. Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall, giving structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. A common misconception is that peptidoglycan gives the cell its shape; however, whereas peptidoglycan helps maintain the structural strength of the cell, it is actually the MreB protein that facilitates cell shape.

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability .

The value of the photosynthetic efficiency is dependent on how light energy is defined -- it depends on whether we count only the light that is absorbed , and on what kind of light is used ( see Photosynthetically active radiation ) . It takes eight ( or perhaps 10 or more ) photons to utilize one molecule of CO . The Gibbs free energy for converting a mole of CO to glucose is 114 kcal , whereas eight moles of photons of wavelength 600 nm contains 381 kcal , giving a nominal efficiency of 30 % . However , photosynthesis can occur with light up to wavelength 720 nm so long as there is also light at wavelengths below 680 nm to keep Photosystem II operating ( see Chlorophyll ) . Using longer wavelengths means less light energy is needed for the same number of photons and therefore for the same amount of photosynthesis . For actual sunlight , where only 45 % of the light is in the photosynthetically active wavelength range , the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11 % . In actuality , however , plants do not absorb all incoming sunlight ( due to reflection , respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels ) and do not convert all harvested energy into biomass , which results in an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation . If photosynthesis is inefficient , excess light energy must be dissipated to avoid damaging the photosynthetic apparatus . Energy can be dissipated as heat ( non-photochemical quenching ) , or emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence .","idx_gold_in_corpus":21034987},{"example_id":1210321528011089603,"question":"what is the number of total presidential electoral votes","answers":["538"],"text":"Each state chooses electors , equal in number to that state 's combined total of senators and representatives .

After its first inception as \"Gablinger's Diet Beer,\" developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as \"Lite\" on packaging and in advertising (with \"Lite Beer from Miller\" being its \"official\" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975. Miller's heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser-Busch played on the branding style of \"Lite\" by highlighting the fact that their beer was called \"Bud Light,\" as \"everything else is just a light.\" In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its \"Lite\" brand as \"Miller Lite.\"","idx_gold_in_corpus":21035059},{"example_id":-2885325042912800073,"question":"who sings the christmas song all i want for christmas is you","answers":["Mariah Carey"],"text":"\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is a Christmas song performed by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey.

God gave Sarai the new name \"Sarah\", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child \"Isaac\" (Hebrew yitschaq, \"laughter\") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, \"God had made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.\" Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company. Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.","idx_gold_in_corpus":21035061},{"example_id":3844547203530823529,"question":"who won the most stanley cups in history","answers":["Montreal Canadiens"],"text":"Most wins : Montreal Canadiens ( 24 )","idx_gold_in_corpus":21030905},{"example_id":8475341882385418406,"question":"when did the song things that make you go hmmm come out","answers":["June 23 , 1991","June 1991"],"text":"'' Things That Make You Go Hmmm ...

It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects .

It is widely rumored that the Cowboys sought a guarantee that they would regularly host Thanksgiving games as a condition of their very first one (since games on days other than Sunday were uncommon at the time and thus high attendance was not a certainty). This is only partly true; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day. In 1975 and 1977, at the behest of then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle, the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team (Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976). Although the Cardinals, at the time known as the \"Cardiac Cards\" due to their propensity for winning very close games, were a modest success at the time, they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys, who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era. This, combined with St. Louis's consistently weak attendance, a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three-game stretch, and opposition from the Kirkwood-Webster Groves Turkey Day Game (a local high school football contest) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978; it was then, after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games, that the Cowboys requested (and received) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever.","idx_gold_in_corpus":21035177},{"example_id":6455569855608254961,"question":"who was the author of the art of war","answers":["Sun Tzu"],"text":"The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Spring and Autumn period in 5th century BC .
